# Avatar Assets

## Required File

- **`base.png`** - Base avatar body (skater character without any equipment)

## Specifications

- **Size**: 1024x1024px (square)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Cartoon/stylized skater character
- **Layers**: Should be designed to have equipment overlaid on top

## What the Base Should Include

- Head/face
- Torso (plain shirt)
- Legs (basic pants)
- Shoes
- Arms in skating position
- Standing on/holding skateboard position

## What NOT to Include

Don't include specific branded clothing or equipment in the base - those will be overlaid as "equipped items."

## Design Tips

- Neutral colors (gray/white shirt, blue jeans)
- Simple, clean design
- Leave room for equipment overlays
- Front-facing or 3/4 view works best

## Placeholder

Until you add the real avatar, you can:
1. Use a simple silhouette
2. Use a placeholder character sprite
3. Generate with AI tools (Midjourney, DALL-E)
4. Commission from an artist

The `AvatarRenderer` component will display this base and overlay equipped items on top.
